# Motivation

"Ethereum developers just play around with smart contracts, don't need to worry about consensus"

- Scott Sunarto

"The big brain giga-chads nerdsniped me into Cosmos"

- Scott Sunarto (roughly paraphrased)

# Cosmos

Most blockchains have:

1. Shared execution layer
2. Smart contracts

## Wat is Comsos?

- Not Cosmos Hub
- Not $ATOM (Bad investment)
- It is the Cosmos SDK + Tendermint Consensus + IBC Modules + other stuff

### Philosophy

- Instead of shared execution layer, you want application specific chains

- Benefit 1: You have control. üññüèΩ
  - **Precompiles**: code that denotes complicated computations cheaper on chain. 
    - If you don't have a precompile, you need to use the evm. 
    - E.g. cryptography. Defined in clients instead of done through the chain.
    - You technically use .com domain as ENS, but this is extremely expensive bc cryptography for DNSSEC is not a precompile. Might cost $1000 to verify. (So technically scott could still use smsunarto.com)
  - You can create novel consensus mechanisms + protocol Design. Osmosis wants to prevent MEV from happening; they want to use threshold encryption to do so. Thus, Osmosis can embed threshold cryptography in their chain

- Benefit 2: Blockspace Monopoly
  - Vertical Scaling brings problems like state bloat, computation power. Solana drops Merkle trees from client design to improve L1 scaling but there will be short term technological limits to vertical scaling. 
  - Cosmos Approach: Instead of scaling vertically, you can create your own blockchain and scale horizontally. (More blockchains instead of faster blockchains) If each application has their own separate throughput, Polygon doesn't get rekt bc people are playing sunflower games.

## IBC

- relies on instant finality
- TCP/IP - not a bridge, but rather a protocol layer
- easy to add Cosmos based blockchains and other blockchains with {easy way to create light client proofs, Relayer}
- peg zone
- **Relayer**: trustless way to send data from one blockchain to another. Think of it as a cable that can transmit data from one chain to another. Security comes from the light client proof, relayers have no verification.
  End Goal: Each wallet is its own relayer. Relayers also get transaction fees in the future. Currently, relayers are subsidized via the Interchain foundation(Ethereum foundation equivalent)
- No flash loans, flash mints, flash anything via IBC bc that requires atomicity.
- Can do token transfers, cross chain swaps

# Questions

## Subnets vs Cosmos

- There is an expectation that you share security with Avalanche. Problem is that shared security isn't free, you need to pay avalanche validators for this.
- Tendermint is novel: instant finality + 2/3 network validators needs to be aligned. Instant finality is huge because it simplifies multichain consensus. In a proof of work blockchain, by the virtue of a 51% attack, blocks are not final since you can end up with uncle blocks [reorgss/o saneel](https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/dr-reorg-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-mev-2ee72b428d1d). Also pls respond in slack saneel...

  - This is bad for bridges because a transaction where you burn a token to mint it via a bridge to a different chain can be reverted due to a reorg.
    - bridge UX gets killed
  - Multihop dexes can take a very long time because you need to wait for probabilistic finality.
- Are there Oracles natively in Cosmos?
  - No current oracles, but can built oracle chain <-- big brain project right here
